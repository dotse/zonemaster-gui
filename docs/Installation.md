## <a name="Docker"></a>Quick installation using a Docker container

Install the docker package on your OS

Follow the installation instructions for your OS -> https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/
	
Pull the docker image containing the complete Zonemaster distribution (GUI + Backend + Engine)

	docker pull afniclabs/zonemaster-gui

Start the container in the background

	docker run -t -p 50080:50080 afniclabs/zonemaster-gui
	
Use the Zonemaster GUI by pointing your browser at

	http://localhost:50080/
	
Use the Zonemaster engine from the command line

	docker run -t -i afniclabs/zonemaster-gui bash
	
## Pre-Requisites

   * Zonemaster-engine should be installed before. Follow the instructions
[here](https://github.com/dotse/zonemaster-engine/blob/master/docs/installation.md)
   * Zonemaster-backend should be installed before. Follow the instructions
[here](https://github.com/dotse/zonemaster-backend/blob/master/docs/installation.md)

## Preamble

Since it is a web application, the Zonemaster Web GUI is a bit more complicated to install than, for example, the test engine. The exact details also depend on the operating system and environment in which it is installed, so it's not really possible to provide general point-by-point instructions.

Basically, the GUI has two major parts. One part is the Perl modules that hold most of the application logic, and the other part is the HTML template files, CSS files, Javascript files and so on that the application logic needs. The Perl module part can be installed as any other Perl module, and is not at all problematic. For the second part, there is no widely accepted place or way to install it, and different operating systems want it in different places. For this reason, we have put all that stuff in a subdirectory of its own in the source code, so you can easily copy it to wherever suits your environment best.

So, in essence, the installation consists of the following steps:

1) Fetch the source code to the Web GUI.

2) Install all the various prerequisite software. This includes the Zonemaster Web Backend, which in turn requires the Zonemaster test engine. The backend also needs access to a database server.

3) Install the Perl module part of the GUI using the usual `perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && make install` sequence.

4) Copy the entire subdirectory `zm_app` from the source code to somewhere suitable. This may be, for example, `/usr/local/webapps/` or `/usr/share/doc/`.

5) Start the server. How to do this can also vary a lot, depending on what else is running on the same server, how much traffic you're expecting to get and such. In any case, you need a server that understands the `PSGI` interface, and it should be pointed at the file `zm_app/bin/app.pl` in the subdirectory you just copied things to (leaving it in the source code also works, of course).

## <a name="Debian"></a> Example installation for Ubuntu Server 14.04LTS

1) Install added prerequisite packages:

    sudo apt-get install libdancer-perl libtext-markdown-perl libtemplate-perl libjson-any-perl

2) Get the source code.

    git clone https://github.com/dotse/zonemaster-gui.git

3) Change to the source code directory.

    cd zonemaster-gui

4) Install the Perl modules.

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    sudo make install

5) Create a directory for the webapp parts, and copy them there.

    sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/doc/zonemaster
    sudo cp -a zm_app /usr/share/doc/zonemaster

6) Start the server:

    sudo starman --listen=:80 /usr/share/doc/zonemaster/zm_app/bin/app.pl

The Doc directory in the source code also has an example Upstart file for the Web GUI starman server.
